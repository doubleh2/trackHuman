<b>Project</b>
<p>This is a R Markdown program that employs a machine learning algorithm  that identify exercises that are performed properly. Denies such as gyros and accelerometers measured key moments of the participant and weight. This data is categorized by the the algorithm.

<b>About the App</b>
<p>This is a project summary. The knitr document provides analysis of human activity monitoring and predicts if the exercise movement was preformed correctly. Its a demonstration of using predictive models for practical problem solving.

<b> Getting Started </b>
<p>Fork the repo run locally using RStudio.

<b> Maintenance </b>
